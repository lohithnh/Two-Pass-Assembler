# Two Pass Assembler

A two-pass assembler is a software tool used in computer programming to convert assembly language code into machine code, which can be directly executed by a computer's processor. Unlike a one-pass assembler, which translates code in a single sweep, a two-pass assembler operates in two distinct phases.
